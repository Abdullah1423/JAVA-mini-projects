<h1 align="center">Java Well Written Mini projects</h1>
In this project, I have tried to write well-written code since I have struggled with code I can't understand, even though I wrote it.
Here you will find many small projects. I have tried to make each one well documented, and there will be a readme to describe each project.

You can be part of this project easily by checking **How To USE**.


## [Spaghetti Code](https://vulcan.io/blog/what-is-spaghetti-code-and-why-is-it-a-problem/)

> Spaghetti code is the general term used for any source code that’s hard to understand because it has no defined structure. While an end user might not see anything wrong with a program, a programmer might find it virtually illegible if the code base’s flow is too convoluted—like a bowl of twisted, tangled spaghetti.

when you search on GitHub Most of what you see is well-written programs, and that will make you think that spaghetti code is not a common issue, but in reality, most spaghetti code is not published because it is not understandable and that is an issue in my opinion and I will tell you why.
* It is a waste of time and effort
since you have spent time making the project why not spend a bit extra time to help everyone? 
* bad habit
you can imagine yourself as an artist, it is not acceptable for Leonardo da Vinci to put his name in something that is not an art for him.

Good programmers write code that humans can understand. ― Martin Fowler
```
## Goal
The goal is to provide many ideas on how to organise your code. The code is short so that hopefully anyone can read the in their free time.
By showing people how Well code is written even if it no advanced they can **grow the discipline of organizing code**.

## Content
Each project will have the following in a readme file:
#### Description
In this section, there will be a brief description of what the program can do and how to use it.
#### Readability
This rating can give you an idea of how well the program is written and divided into five levels as **5** is the most Organise.
#### Level
This can give you an idea of how complex the program is.
I suggest taking one that is not easy and not too hard, so you can have the most benefit.
there are five levels :
1. Beginner
2. Advanced Beginner
3. Intermediate
4. Advanced
5. Expert

|Num|Name|Readability|Level|
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | | | |
| 2 | | | |
| 3 | | | |
| 4 | | | |
| 5 | | | |
| 6 | | | |
| 7 | | | |
| 8 | | | |
| 9 | | | |
| 10 | | | |

## How To Use
You can upload your code with a description and I will be happy to give it the ratings.
Most programs have a description of how to use each program, but in general, you can do the following:
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository
3. Add your contributions (code or documentation)
4. Commit and push
5. Wait for the pull request to be merged
