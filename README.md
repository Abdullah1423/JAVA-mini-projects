<h1 align="center">Java Well Written Mini projects</h1>

In this project, I have tried to write well-written code since I have struggled with code I can't understand, even though I wrote it.
Here you will find many small projects; I have tried to make each one well documented, and there will be a readme to describe each project.

You can be part of this project easily, check **How To Contribute** for more details.


## [spaghetti code](https://vulcan.io/blog/what-is-spaghetti-code-and-why-is-it-a-problem/)
> Spaghetti code is the general term used for any source code that’s hard to understand because it has no defined structure. While an end user might not see anything wrong with a program, a programmer might find it virtually illegible if the code base’s flow is too convoluted—like a bowl of twisted, tangled spaghetti.

when you search on GitHub Most of what you see is wee written programs and that will make you think that spaghetti code is not a common issue, but in reality, most spaghetti code is not published because it is not understandable and that is an issue in my opinion and I will tell you why.
* It is a waste of time and effort
since you have spent time making the project why not spend a bit extra time to help everyone? 
* bad habit
you can imagine yourself as an artist, it is not acceptable for Leonardo da Vinci to put his name in something that is not an art for him.
